# Stale Branches

Finds and deletes stale branches. By default it aligns with
[this](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/viewing-branches-in-your-repository) definition, but can be
configured for other use cases.

When a branch has been inactive for more than the `days-before-stale` input, it is considered stale. The branch will be deleted once it has been inactive longer than `days-before-delete`.

- By default, a stale branch is defined as a branch that:
  - has had no commits in the last 120 days.
  - has no protection rules.
  - is not the default branch of the repository.
  - See [inputs](https://github.com/crs-k/stale-branches#inputs) for more info.
- See [example workflow](https://github.com/crs-k/stale-branches#example-workflow).

## Usage

### Pre-requisites

Create a workflow `.yml` file in your repository's `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help
Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Inputs

Inputs are defined in [`action.yml`](action.yml). None are required.:
